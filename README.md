# Chat-room-v2.0
This is a chat application created using Python and Socket module. This is the best chat application currently on github made with python. This is a GUI application. Its GUI has been created using the Tkinter module. It offers the features like login, register, shows all the users on database, show all the active users, account settings, logout, clear chat, avatars, change username, password or avatar, etc. Personally i used mysql for database to keep user data. But because of safety reasons i can not upload that files. So, i created a CSV database to publish on Github. If you are capable enough you may again change CSV to mysql. I hope you will enjoy my application.
